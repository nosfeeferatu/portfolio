                <h3>Jack of All Trades, Master of None</h3>
                <small>8th December 2022</small>
                <p>"Jack of all trades, master of none." <br>This is a saying I dreadfully carried with me for a long time. Growing up, I was always hobby hopping; jumping to the next skill or platform that fascinates my eye. I'd tried a little bit of everything: writing, drawing, dancing, photography, videography, singing, theatre, voice acting, editing, playing a piano, the list goes on. I never stayed too long with some of them. I was drawn by the next cool thing I saw someone do that I wanted to try too.</p>
                <p>The saying continually rang in my ears. There was nothing I was really good at. Master at none. Never good enough for anyone.</p>  
                <p>Then I was told the supposedly complete version of that saying: "Jack of all trades, master of none, but often times better than a master of one." I don't know if this indeed is real, but it definitely still did it for me.</p>                 
                <p>Because yeah, if I could be a master at something, I would love to be. But being a Jack of all trades isn't all that bad. It may not make me the best at something in one room, but it makes me good enough for it in another room.</p>               
                <p>I'm no technological wizard, but I've managed to save my uncle's company days of work and money with what I can do. For him, I am a tech wizard. I'm no Photoshop king, but I can do enough to use it in my Web Development journey now without having to repeatedly annoy the graphic designers in the office. I do go back to some of them every now and then. And each time I get just a little better at it. And I continue to try out new things along the way.</p>
